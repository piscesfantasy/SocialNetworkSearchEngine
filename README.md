SocialNetworkSearchEngine
=========================

This was my final project for grad-school class "Design Pattern and Software Development" of National Taiwan University (NTU) in Spring 2012. This project was done in pair-programming. My partner, Yung-Hsiang Yang (Github ID: larry61410) implemented API calls to social networks with Python. And I, Yow-Bang Wang (Github ID: piscesfantasy), was in charge of framework design the remaining implementations with C++. The first version support search on Plurk and Twitter. Main functions include keyword/friend search, browsing search results, recommendation and reply.

[2015/12/28]
- Rewrite Twitter/Twitter_Query.py for new Twitter API; keyword searching is currently unavailable.
- Will remove Plurk and maybe add Facebook

[2015/12/29]
- Completely recovered search on Twitter
