SocialNetworkSearchEngine
=========================

This is my final project of grad-school class "Design Pattern and Software Development" of National Taiwan University (NTU) in Spring 2012. This project is done in pair-programming. My partner (larry61410) was mainly in charge of the implementation of API calls to social networks. And I was in charge of framework design the remaining implementations.
