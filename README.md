SocialNetworkSearchEngine
=========================

This was my final project of grad-school class "Design Pattern and Software Development" of National Taiwan University (NTU) in Spring 2012. This project is done in pair-programming. My partner (Yung-Hsiang Yang, Git ID: larry61410) was mainly in charge of the implementation of API calls to social networks. And I (Yow-Bang Wang, Git ID: piscesfantasy) was in charge of framework design the remaining implementations. In this project we implemented a social network search engine with C++ and Python. The first version support search on Plurk and Twitter. Main functions include keyword/friend search, browsing search results, recommendation and reply.
